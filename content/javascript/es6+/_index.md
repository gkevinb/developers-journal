## JavaScript vs ECMAScript

Sometimes there can be some confusion between what is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript. Basically, ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages and JavaScript is a language that follows that standard. ECMAScript helps JavaScript be compatible across different browsers and adds cool new features to the language.

One of the most major changes to JavaScript came with the release of ES6, or the 6th edition of ECMAScript in 2015. Cool features like const and let variables, classes, arrow functions, etc, were added to JavaScript.

Since 2015, each year a new version of ECMAScript is released that improves the JavaScript language. So when next time you see ES6+, just think of it as JavaScript with all the new features that ECMAScript introduced since ES6.
