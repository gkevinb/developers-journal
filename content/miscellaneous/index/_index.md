## My Developer's Journal

----

Here lies the Developer's Journal of Gabor Kevin Barta. The purpose of this journal is to maintain a digital notebook to record programming snippets and document new programming techniques. After countless attempts of trying to find a note taking app that is atleast one tier above being classified as useless. I stumbled upon Typora which is a lightweight yet robust markdown editor. In my search for a note taking app, my requirements were the following:

- Markdown file support
- Export to HTML
- Save content as Markdown files
- Nice file navigation

Typora seams to be the perfect match. Therefore, this journal from now on is being modified through the Typora app. With the above mentioned features, I am able to save my Developer's Journal on Github (it is currently saved on Dropbox) and even convert it into a website with the help of Typora, by exporting the markdown files to html files.

More information on Typora can be found on there [website](https://www.typora.io/).
