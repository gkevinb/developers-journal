## Gambler's Fallacy

> The false assumption that past independent events have an effect on future outcomes.

Gambler's tend to make a false assumption that if you have been on a losing streak for a while, then the chances of winning will increase since you have not won in a while. There is a false sense of balancing in one's mind. That the losing streaks and winning streaks will eventually balance out.

## Software Archaeology

Software archaelogy is the study of old legacy code, usually with little to no documentation.

>Everything that is there is there for a reason, and there are 3 possible reasons:
>1. It used to need to be there but no longer does
>2. It never needed to be there and the person that wrote the code had no clue
>3. It STILL needs to be there and YOU have no clue
>
>The corollary to this "law" is that, until you know which was the reason, you should NOT modify the code (or data).
