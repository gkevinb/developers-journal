## Software Archaeology

Everything that is there is there for a reason, and there are 3 possible reasons:
1. It used to need to be there but no longer does
2. It never needed to be there and the person that wrote the code had no clue
3. It STILL needs to be there and YOU have no clue

The corollary to this "law" is that, until you know which was the reason, you should NOT modify the code (or data).
